		<h1>Are you an Introvert or an Extrovert?</h1>
		<p>This quiz tests for the cognitive (Jungian) definitions and NOT the common definitions (sociability).</p>
    <p>Jungian definitions are concerned about the individual's perception of life whereas the common definition is more concerned about behaviors and social interactions of the individual. For example: You may be an introvert according to the Jungian definition and an ambivert according to the common definition.</p>
